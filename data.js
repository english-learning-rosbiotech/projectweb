    text: `Computer hardware is divided into external components like the case, input devices (keyboard, mouse, microphone), and output devices (monitor, speakers, printer). The case houses and protects the internal components, including the motherboard, which serves as the main circuit board connecting all parts.

The CPU, or processor, acts as the computer's "brain" by processing large amounts of information at high speed and performing arithmetic and logical functions. The GPU handles all visual data by rendering and manipulating images, graphics, and videos.

RAM is a volatile, short-term memory that temporarily stores information while the computer is powered on, and all unsaved data is lost when power is turned off. HDDs and SSDs are non-volatile storage devices that permanently save data even when the computer is shut down.

The power supply unit provides electricity to all components by connecting to a power outlet or battery. Software includes application packages like Microsoft Office, email programs, web browsers, and productivity tools, while the operating system is the most critical piece of software. The operating system controls all computer functions, manages both hardware and software components, and serves as the interface between them. The most popular operating systems today are Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux, which is widely used by developers.`,

    text: `Online competitive gaming, also known as e-sports, has become increasingly popular in recent years. One of the main advantages of online competitive gaming is its accessibility. This inclusivity has allowed people from all walks of life to participate and compete at a high level, regardless of their age or gender.

Furthermore, online competitive gaming provides a platform for individuals to showcase their skills and talents. Another benefit of online competitive gaming is the sense of community it fosters. Players can connect with others who share their interests, forming friendships and support networks.

However, there are also some drawbacks to online competitive gaming. One of the most significant concerns is the potential for addiction. Players may spend excessive amounts of time gaming, neglecting other important aspects of their lives. Additionally, the competitive nature of online gaming can sometimes lead to toxic behavior.

Developers and organisations must take steps to address these issues and promote inclusivity and sportsmanship within the community. In conclusion, online competitive gaming offers numerous benefits, such as accessibility, opportunities for self-expression, and a sense of belonging, but it's essential for players to be mindful of their gaming habits and to prioritise their well-being.`,

    text: `Cybersecurity involves defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. Network security focuses on securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.

Application security aims to keep software and devices free of threats, with successful security beginning in the design stage. Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.

Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets, as well as user permissions and data storage procedures. Disaster recovery policies dictate how an organization restores its operations and information after a cybersecurity incident.

Business continuity is the plan an organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources. End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cybersecurity factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments and avoid unidentified USB drives is vital for the security of any organization.`,
